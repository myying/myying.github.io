<p>I just finished a three-week trip in China. I visited atmospheric science departments in several universities in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Guangzhou, and talked to researchers from many different backgrounds. I showed my recent work on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-19-0170.1">multiscale alignment method</a>, and received a lot of feedback and suggestions, I really enjoyed all the discussion! </p>
