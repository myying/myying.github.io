      Data assimilation seeks to find the best estimate of the state of a dynamical system and its uncertainty by combining information from model forecasts and observations. It has been adopted for state and parameter estimation for a wide range of dynamical systems across many disciplines such as weather, ocean, land, water, air quality, climate, ecosystem and astrophysics. This course covers various data assimilation approaches such as variational, ensemble-based, hybrid and nonlinear methods. </p>
