<p>This week the 101st AMS annual meetings took place, we had a new virtual format this year, everyone recorded their talk at home and had a round of lightning talks and Q/A in each session. I co-chaired a <a href="https://ams.confex.com/ams/101ANNUAL/meetingapp.cgi/Session/57465">DA methodology session </a>in the conference on IOAS-AOLS, and talked about my recent progress in applying the MSA method in two scenarios: hurricane forecasts and sea ice forecasts.</p>
