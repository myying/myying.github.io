I showed some preliminary results on assimilating sea ice deformation features at the EnKF Workshop in Norheimsund. The challenge of assimilating deformation is that they are spatial gradients of the velocity fields, and therefore are related to the model sea ice velocity nonlinearly. I used a 1D example to illustrate the effect of nonlinear position errors on the assimilation. Here are the <a href="pages/presentations/20230502/slides.pdf">presentation slides</a>.
