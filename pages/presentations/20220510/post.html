<p>Postponed by COVID for a year, it finally took place. Today feels like a normal group meeting day again back in Penn State with us honoring <a href="https://ams.confex.com/ams/35Hurricanes/meetingapp.cgi/Session/61379">Fuqing's contributions to the tropical meteorology community</a>.  We told stories about Fuqing and their impact on our research lives, it was enjoyable time with my academic sisters and brothers.</p>
