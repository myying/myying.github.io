          <p>Ever-increasing complexity of multiscale dynamical systems poses challenges to data assimilation methods. Rapid error growth at small scales gives rise to nonlinearity, and multiscale systems typically have large dimensionality as well. Currently, methods based on linearization, such as the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), work efficiently for large problems but cannot handle high nonlinearity. On the other hand, nonlinear methods, such as the Particle Filter, are still not feasible for large dimensional problems. New methods are developed for multiscale problems.</p>
