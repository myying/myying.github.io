<p>The Arctic sea ice is declining in its extent and thickness under global warming, which brings both risks and opportunities for human activities in the Polar region. Sea ice forecasts are vital for sea navigators to ensure safety of operation. While basin-wide sea ice evolves slowly and robust model forecasts are made on seasonal scales, small kilometer-scale ice features such as open leads formed by the fractured ice are much harder to predict. Currently, at NERSC, we are actively working on evaluating the predictability of these features, and developing ensemble data assimilation techniques to effectively assimilate these features to provide skillful forecasts.</p>
