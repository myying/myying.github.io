      <p>The 34th AMS Conference on Hurricanes and Tropical Meteorology has been postponed for a year, and finally took place this week. I presented my research on <a href="https://ams.confex.com/ams/34HURR/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/373620">reducing position errors in hurricane prediction</a>. Yet another application scenario for the MSA method.</p>

      <p>This week the 101st AMS annual meetings took place, we had a new virtual format this year, everyone recorded their talk at home and had a round of lightning talks and Q/A in each session. I co-chaired a <a href="https://ams.confex.com/ams/101ANNUAL/meetingapp.cgi/Session/57465">DA methodology session </a>in the conference on IOAS-AOLS, and talked about my recent progress in applying the MSA method in two scenarios: hurricane forecasts and sea ice forecasts. Check out my talk here:</p>

      <h2 id="aug.1.20">August 1, 2020</h2>
      <p>Today I start working as a researcher in <a href="https://www.nersc.no">NERSC</a>, the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center in Bergen, Norway. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I am still physically in the US and working remotely. I am working on introducing a multiscale data assimilation method for sea-ice modeling and regional climate prediction.</p>

      <h2 id="jan.13.20">January 13, 2020</h2>
      <p>This week marks the centennial for the American Meteorological Society and the annual meetings are held in Boston. It is my first time charing a session this year! The session is called <a href="https://ams.confex.com/ams/2020Annual/meetingapp.cgi/Session/51083">"Advances in ensemble DA methods for highly nonlinear and large dimensional systems"</a>, where we had speakers showcasing their new developments in data assimilation methodology that meets the challenges in ever increasing complexity of prediction systems. I also gave a talk on my newly developed multiscale ensemble filtering framework, here is a recording: </p>

      <p>I just finished a three-week trip in China. I visited atmospheric science departments in several universities in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Guangzhou, and talked to researchers from many different backgrounds. I showed my recent work on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-19-0170.1">multiscale alignment method</a>, and recieved a lot of feedback and suggestions, I really enjoyed all the discussion! <br/>
