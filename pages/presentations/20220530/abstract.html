<p>The 2022 <a href="https://enkf.norceprosjekt.no/enkf-workshop/enkf-workshop-2022-kviknes-hotel-balestrand-norway">EnKF Workshop</a> takes place in a hybrid form. Locally, we took a boat trip from Bergen to Balestrand, while our colleagues joined online. In the workshop, I gave a talk on my work of developing DA methodology for the challenging sea ice forecast problems.</p>
