I gave an online <a href="https://sasip-climate.github.io/categories/webinars/">SASIP Webinar</a>, reporting my work of developing sea ice data assimilation techniques in <a href="https://sasip-climate.github.io/research/work-package-four/">WP4</a>.

Sea ice linear kinematic features, such as leads and ridges, play an important role in daily sea ice forecasts. The neXtSIM model developed in SASIP allows faithful representation of these features in forecasts. In WP4 we have been developing a data assimilation software, called NEDAS, to assimilate additional observations of these features derived from high-resolution SAR images and improve the forecasts. In this webinar I will describe the issues we had encountered in feature-based assimilation for both the Lagrangian and the Direct-Galerkin versions of neXtSIM, and report on preliminary assessment of the forecast performance of the new assimilation software.
