This week I attended the AGU 2018 fall meeting in Washington D.C. and gave a presentation in the <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm18/prelim.cgi/Session/63534">Advances in Data Assimilation</a> session in Nonlinear Geophysics. Right afterwards, I joined the <a href="http://adapt.psu.edu/2018EnKFWorkshop/SYMPOSIUM18/index.php">Second ADAPT Symposium</a> at Penn State. It's nice to meet old friends and get to know new students in the department. It surely was an intense week!
