<p>Today I gave a <a href="http://www.met.psu.edu/news-events/events/meteo-colloquia/2021-colloquia/yue-ying">Meteo Colloquium</a> at Penn State. I shared my experiences in developing DA method, how I borrowed ideas from other disciplines, how I tested new DA methods in real application problems, and my vision for the future of the Earth system science from a DA research perspective.</p>
