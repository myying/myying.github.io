<p>Today marks the end of the Summer School on High Impact Convective-scale Weather held at Peking University. Drs. Robert Houze, Richard Johnson, Fuqing Zhang, Paul Markowski, Matthew Parker, and David Schultz offered an awesome series of lectures with unique insights to convective-scale weather research. By the end, I even got some encouraging words and autographs on my notebook!</p>
