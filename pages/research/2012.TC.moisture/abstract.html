          <p>No two tropical cyclones are the same. Sometimes they can have vastly different size and intensity, and both become very destructive. This picture shows an example. Bilis 2006 was large and weak, but brought much water damage; Saomai 2006 was small but strong, and induced a lot of wind damage. To understand tropical cyclones, studying their structural changes is as important as any single parameter.</p>
