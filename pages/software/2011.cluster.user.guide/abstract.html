    <p>In 2009, as I started my master degree program in Peking University, I learned how to use high performance supercomputers and worked as a part-time system administrator for a small 32-node cluster hosted in the Department of Atmospheric Science. I wrote this
    <a href="pages/software/2011.cluster.user.guide/userguideV2.pdf">Cluster User Guide V2</a> (in Chinese) to help fellow students learn how to use the cluster system for their research. The document received more attention than I expected, it was even circulating among students and researchers outside Peking University.
