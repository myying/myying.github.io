I gave a <a href="https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/event_series/seminar-introducing-nedas-light-weight-and-scalable-python-solution-ensemble-data">CISL Seminar</a> today at NCAR introducing the new Python DA software <a href="https://github.com/nansencenter/NEDAS">NEDAS</a>.
</p>
<p>
NEDAS provides a light-weight Python solution for implementing ensemble data assimilation methods for geophysical models. Thanks to its modular and scalable design, a wide range of ensemble assimilation algorithms become feasible for large-dimensional models. NEDAS provides a collection of state-of-the-art algorithms from existing research software using two main strategies: (1) serial assimilation where observations are used one at a time to update the model state iteratively, (2) batch assimilation where observations are in a local analysis for each model state. One can test new algorithmic ideas in NEDAS and compare them with existing methods early-on before committing resources to full implementation in a real operational setting. In this talk, Iâ€™ll describe the architectural design of NEDAS, highlight some new algorithmic ideas, and show some computational benchmarks as a guidance for picking the right algorithm in different application scenarios.
