      <p>Tropical weather systems are important components of the global circulation that span a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. At large scales, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the dominant mode. At small scales, moist convective systems dominate. Atmospheric wave motion due to Earth's rotation and gravity fills the spectrum, including the equatorial Rossby (ER), Kelvin, mixed-Rossby-gravity (MRG), and inertia-gravity (IG) waves. The coupling between large-scale waves and small-scale moist convection makes the predictability of tropical weather both flow and scale dependent.</p>
      <p>In <a href="pages/publications/YingZhang2017JAS.pdf">Ying and Zhang 2017</a>, we estimated the predictability of tropical weather through ensemble perturbation experiments using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The following figure summarizes our findings. </p>

      <p>Thick lines are practical predictability horizon (days) plotted as a function of spatial scales. Thin lines are the intrinsic limits of predictability, found by reducing the initial perturbations to a much smaller amount. Small-scale moist convection features more rapid error growth which places an intrinsic limit on the predictability of these systems. On the other hand, large-scale forcing from wave patterns serves as a source of predictability.</p>
      <p>Currently, there is still room for improving the prediction skill before hitting the intrinsic limit. In <a href="pages/publications/YingZhang2018JAS.pdf">Ying and Zhang 2018</a>, we evaluated the potential impact from assimilating satellite-derived observations on tropical weather predictability. </p>

          <p>This figure shows the observing networks that we evaluated, including temperature and moisture profiles retrieved from the Advanced TIROS Operational Vertical Sounders (ATOVS) and the GPS Radio Occultation (GPSRO) technique. While large-scale component can be well constrained using these observations, the convective scale still lacks spatial resolution to obtain enough information. Better design of observing networks is still necessary to further improve tropical weather predictability.</p>
