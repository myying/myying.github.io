<p>Today I start working as a researcher in <a href="https://www.nersc.no">NERSC</a>, the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center in Bergen, Norway. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I am still physically in the US and working remotely. I am working on introducing a multiscale data assimilation method for sea-ice modeling and regional climate prediction.</p>
