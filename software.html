<h2 id="2022.NEDAS">NEDAS: The Next-generation Ensemble Data Assimilation System</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nansencenter/NEDAS">NEDAS</a> provides a light-weight Python solution to the ensemble data assimilation (DA) problem for geophysical models. It serves as a new test environment for DA researchers. Thanks to its modular and scalable design, new DA algorithms can be rapidly tested and developed even for large-dimensional models. NEDAS offers a collection of state-of-the-art DA algorithms, including both serial and batch assimilation approaches. NEDAS offers DA researchers with new ideas to test their prototypes early-on in real-model-like environments, before committing resources to full implementation in operational systems. <p>

<h2 id="2015.PSU_WRF_EnKF">The PSU_WRF_EnKF data assimilation system</h2>
    <p>The Pennsylvania State University Ensemble Kalman Filter system for the Weather Research and Forecasting model (PSU_WRF_EnKF) originated from Fuqing Zhang's project code when he was a postdoc at NCAR. The project was a proof of concept for <a href="http://adapt.psu.edu/ZHANG/papers/SnyderZhang2003MWR.pdf">radar data assimilation for the convective-scale weather</a>. It quickly evolved and became a reseach testbed for ensemble data assimilation methods and their application to various weather systems. It was also developed into a quasi-operational <a href="http://hfip.psu.edu/">hurricane ensemble forecast system</a>. The PennState <a href="http://adapt.psu.edu">ADAPT</a> center currently host the PSU_WRF_EnKF system development team, and aims to further apply data assimilation and predictability techniques to many fields beyond weather prediction.</p>

    <p>The PSU_WRF_EnKF code should be downloaded from the official <a href="http://adapt.psu.edu/index.php?loc=outreach">Code Release Page</a>.</p>
    <p>I contributed to the development of the PSU_WRF_EnKF system as Fuqing's PhD student. In 2012, I rewrote the Fortran MPI parallel algorithms and increased the efficiency of the system. I also participated in the development of assimilation capability for satellite radiance data and many other types of observing systems. By the time I graduate in 2018, I wrote this <a href="pages/software/2015.PSU_WRF_EnKF/system_technote.pdf"><i class="fa fa-file"></i>Technical Note</a> to comprehensively document the current system and describe its components.</p>

<h2 id="2011.cluster.user.guide">Supercomputer Cluster User Guide</h2>
    <p>In 2009, as I started my master degree program in Peking University, I learned how to use high performance supercomputers and worked as a part-time system administrator for a small 32-node cluster hosted in the Department of Atmospheric Science. I wrote this
    <a href="pages/software/2011.cluster.user.guide/userguideV2.pdf">Cluster User Guide V2</a> (in Chinese) to help fellow students learn how to use the cluster system for their research. The document received more attention than I expected, it was even circulating among students and researchers outside Peking University.
