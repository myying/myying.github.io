I attended a sea ice data assimilation workshop <a href="https://iicwg-da-11.met.no/programme">ICCWG-DA-11</a> in Oslo this week. This is my first time in a conference with sea ice experts and I learned new information from ice remote sensing and model rheologies. There are many cool presentations on the topic of improving sea ice forecasts, especially for the short timescales.

I showed some neXtSIM model forecasts and evaluation of sea ice predictability across scales in this <a href="pages/presentations/20230321/poster.pdf">poster</a>.
I also included an initial proof-of-concept for assimilating sea ice deformation from SAR imagery that can potentially improve the smaller-scale details of the model simulated sea ice.
