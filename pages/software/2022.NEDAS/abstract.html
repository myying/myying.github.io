<p><a href="https://github.com/nansencenter/NEDAS">NEDAS</a> provides a light-weight Python solution to the ensemble data assimilation (DA) problem for geophysical models. It serves as a new test environment for DA researchers. Thanks to its modular and scalable design, new DA algorithms can be rapidly tested and developed even for large-dimensional models. NEDAS offers a collection of state-of-the-art DA algorithms, including both serial and batch assimilation approaches. NEDAS offers DA researchers with new ideas to test their prototypes early-on in real-model-like environments, before committing resources to full implementation in operational systems. <p>
