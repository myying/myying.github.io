    <p>Tropical weather systems are important components of the global circulation that span a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. At large scales, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the dominant mode. At small scales, moist convective systems dominate. Atmospheric wave motion due to Earth's rotation and gravity fills the spectrum, including the equatorial Rossby (ER), Kelvin, mixed-Rossby-gravity (MRG), and inertia-gravity (IG) waves. The figure on the left shows the multiscale nature of tropical rainfall (mm/day). The coupling between large-scale waves and small-scale moist convection makes the predictability of tropical weather both flow and scale dependent.</p>
    <p>In my PhD work I identified the predictability limits for tropical atmosphere, establishing an upper bound in expected prediction skill of these weather systems. I also addressed the questions of how much future satellite observations can improve the prediction skill, and how to design ensemble data assimilation methods that make better use of the available observations.</p>
